// Midterm Project: Distributed lock server
// Build a distributed lock server. Define how a host implements your
// protocol in host.v.dfy; write your safety spec and proof here.

// This challenge differs from LockServer (from chapters 03 and 04) in two
// ways. First, there is no central server that coordinates the activity.
// Second, the hosts can communicate only via asynchronous messages; a single
// state machine transition cannot simultaneously read or update the state of
// two hosts.
//
// To guard against duplicate messages, the nodes associate a monotonically
// increasing epoch number with the lock. Initially, node 0 holds the lock and
// its epoch number is 1, while all other nodes with an epoch of 0 (and not
// holding the lock). A node that holds the lock can "grant" it to another
// node by sending them a "Grant" message which has an epoch number that is
// greater than the node's epoch number. A node that receives such a message
// will become the new holder and will set its epoch number to the messageâ€™s
// epoch number.

// You'll first need to modify 'host.v.dfy' to define the protocol message
// format and the host behavior.
// Then come back here to define the safety condition and prove that the
// distributed system made from that protocol maintains it.

// The ".t.dfy" extension in network.t.dfy and distributed_system.t.dfy
// indicates these files are _trusted_: they are assumed correct. In contrast,
// the ".v.dfy" in host.v.dfy indicates that the code in that file is verified.
// This file (exercise01.dfy) doesn't have an extension. It mixes some trusted
// code (your safety specification and the statement of the safety theorem) and
// untrusted, verified code (your inductive invariant). We mix these only to
// make navigating your code a bit simpler.
